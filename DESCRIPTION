Description: A High Dimensionality growing self-organizing map (GrowingSOM, GSOM) is a growing variant of the popular self-organizing map (SOM).
    A growing self-organizing map is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a 
    two-dimensional representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map. This HDGSOM have been improved,
